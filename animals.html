      Horses are very beneficial on a farm. People can ride them to check on
      their herds, whether that be cattle, sheep,<br />or various other animals.
      Horses are also be used to drive cattle to pens so they can be doctored or
      sheep to the<br />barn to be sheared. They can also be ridden in many
      places where other vehicles cannot. This also makes them<br />extremely
      useful when navigating rough terrain. Draft horses have been used for many
      years to plow fields or<br />pull wagons, making them essential for
      farming also.

    <h3>Beef Cows</h3>

    <p id="styled-paragraph">
      There are many different breeds of beef cows. Some are Angus, Brahman,
      Hereford, and Charolais. Beef cattle<br />have been bred to produce
      muscle, not milk, which makes them much heftier than dairy cows.

    <h3>Dairy Cows</h3>

      alt="Jersey dairy cows."
      class="center"
    />
    <p id="styled-paragraph">
      There are also different breeds of dairy cows. Some are Holstein, Jersey,
      Brown Swiss, and Guernsey. Dairy<br />cows are leaner, not uncommon to see
      their hip bones, than beef cows. This is because they are bred to
      produce<br />milk.

    <p id="styled-paragraph">
      Chickens are also an essential farm animal. There are many different
      breeds of chickens, but they are separated<br />by meat chickens and
      laying hens. Meat chickens are raised specifically for their meat. Laying
      hens produce<br />eggs, which are collected daily.

    <p id="styled-paragraph">
      Pigs are another farm animal that is raised primarily for meat. Different
      breeds of pigs produce different quality<br />of meat. Some are better for
      bacon, while some are better for lard.

    <p id="styled-paragraph">
      Goats are beneficial to farms because they can be used for multiple
      different reasons. They can just be pets and<br />keep your land clear by
      grazing, or they can be used for their milk, wool, or meat.

    <p id="styled-paragraph">
      Sheep are livestock who are raised for their wool. They are also raised
      for their milk and meat. Sheep milk<br />makes superior cheese and their
      meat is one of the healthier ones you can eat. Their wool has very
      durable<br />insulation and also regulates humidity.

    <h3>Guardians</h3>

      alt="Four donkeys."
      class="center"
    />
    <p id="styled-paragraph">
      Livestock guardians can be different types of animals. The most common are
      donkeys and livestock guardian<br />dogs, or LGD. Livestock guardian dogs
      were specifically bred to protect livestock from potential predators.<br />
      Livestock guardians are around the herd they are protecting constantly.
      Donkeys tend to protect cattle, so they<br />stay in the same field as the
      cows at all times. LGD are aggressive towards predators, but very gentle
      with<br />
      people or small livestock.
